            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                American Sign Language (ASL) has its roots in the early 19th century, influenced by French Sign Language (LSF) and various regional sign systems.
                It was formalized in the United States with the establishment of the first school for the Deaf in 1817.
                Over the years, ASL has evolved into a fully developed language with its own grammar and syntax.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Why ASL is Important?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                ASL is the primary language of the Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities in North America.
                It promotes inclusivity, allowing communication without barriers.
                Learning ASL can help bridge gaps between the hearing and Deaf communities, fostering greater accessibility and understanding.
